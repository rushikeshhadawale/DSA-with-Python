# Explaination of Program

# Create a list arr with 5 elements.

# Find the number of elements in the list using len(arr) and store it in n.

# Print a heading “Array elements:” without moving to a new line.

# Loop through each element of the list from the first to the last.

# Print each element on the same line, separated by a space.

# Move to a new line after printing all elements.
